this is a short description of the first project assigned in soc 273L, computational social sciences. the project involved three parts. first, i created a repository to contain all future projects for the class. in this repo, i set up a folder for "project 1" and added a text file with all the commands i ran. second, i set up a repository to learn github's collaborative tools, and added two of my classmates as collaborators. we used this repo to familiarize ourselves with github's collaboration and version control workflow. third, i set up my personal github website using another repo and added some personal information to this site.
